##What is it?
This is an Android selfie app, plain and simple. It works with selfie sticks which plug into the headphone jack.

Rather than listening for a KeyEvent generated by the system, it "listens" to the audio input from the stick, approximates an envelope for the signal by squaring the samples and running them through a low-pass filter, and takes a picture if the signal crosses a threshold.

##Features
 - Toggles between front and rear facing cameras.
 - Toggles flash. If the front facing camera is selected, and there is no hardware flash, the screen will shine bright white before taking a selfie.
 - Opens the user's preferred gallery with an Intent.
